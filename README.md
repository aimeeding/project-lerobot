## Project Overview

This repository documents my internship work on the **Lerobot Open Source Project**, focusing on robotic assembly, data collection, and model training using the Huggingface Lerobot framework.

Lerobot is an open-source project focused on making robot learning more accessible. This internship involved implementing the complete Lerobot pipeline, from hardware setup through data collection to model training, demonstrating practical applications of imitation learning for robotic manipulation tasks.

- **Hardware**: So-arm101 leader and follwer arms
- **Data Collection**: Wrist and top camera for manipulation recording
- **Training Infrastructure**: 
  - Local: MSI latop with 4070 GPU (slow)
  - Remote: Desktop PC with A6000 GPU(faster)

**Internship Period:** May 19, 2025 - July 27, 2025 (10 weeks)

## Project Objectives

Explore robot pick and place with non-classic approach using the Lerobot open source framework, from hardware setup through data collection to model training and evaluation.

## Project Workflow

The project follows four main phases:

1. **Materials & Environment Setup** - SO-ARM101 parts print and order, Lerobot environment configuration
2. **Assembly & Calibration** - Mechanical assembly and system calibration
3. **Data Collection** - Teleoperation, camera setup, and dataset collection
4. **Local Training** - Model(ACT, GROOT) training, deployment, and evaluation
